# Mobileye Project

Detecting traffic lights and estimating the distance to them within given video using image processing and machine learning.

This project is parted into 4 phases:

## 1. traffic Lights Attention
Detection of source lights in an image using convolution with customized high-pass filter and local maximum.

## 2. Traffic Lights Detection
Generating Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to determine on the candidates from the previous phase whether a traffic light or not,
using the the attention code output as labeled data for training, in order to optimize the training and reduce overfitting.

## 3. Distance Estimating
Estimation the distance of each traffic light using Struct From Motion and geometric calculations.

## 4. Integration
Integrating all the previous parts into a complete software product.
